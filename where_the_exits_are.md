**WHERE THE EXITS ARE**

I look into your eyes and wonder if you recognize me.

I search for the way you looked at me that night, when there was music in this room and your hand was warm against mine, when you did not know what I was or what I would become. I wait for that flicker of recognition, that brief, impossible softness that made me believe, for one evening, that I could be seen and not be feared, that all the sharp and broken parts of me could be held together instead of hidden. Instead your gaze skims over my face like it belongs to a stranger. Maybe it does. Maybe the person you saw that night never made it out of here at all, and all that’s left standing in front of you now is the quiet body she left behind.

So I will start there, with the version of me who still believed she could leave before anyone noticed her, and with the night I first saw you across this room.


Back then, the room was smaller. Or maybe it was just fuller. Every corner had a body leaning in it, every surface had a glass or a bottle or an ashtray someone had promised to empty and never did. Someone had strung colored lights along the ceiling and over the curtain rail, so the walls pulsed red and blue and sickly green, and if you squinted you could almost pretend it was flattering.

I arrived late on purpose. That is one of my small kindnesses to myself: I let other people fill the space first so I have something to press my back against when I get there. The invitation had sat in my messages all week, glowing each time I checked my phone for anything else. I had said no twice, then maybe, then nothing. In the end I went because it was easier than explaining why I would rather sit alone in my kitchen and listen to my neighbors argue through the heating pipes.

The door opened before I could knock properly. A face I half-recognized from work pulled me in with the kind of enthusiasm people reserve for lost packages finally arriving. There were arms around my shoulders, breath too close to my ear, a voice shouting that they were so glad I came, that I never come to anything, that tonight I had to have fun. I smiled the way you show your teeth to a dog that might bite you.

Inside, the air was already thick with sweat and cheap perfume and something fried in oil long past forgiving. Music hammered against my ribs, some song everyone else seemed to know the words to. I kept my coat on for a moment too long, like armor, before realizing that made me stand out more, not less. I shrugged it off and folded it over my arm, suddenly unsure where to put my hands.

I did what I always do in rooms like that: I found the edges. I followed the wall past the cluster dancing in the middle, past the couple already pressed against the hallway doorframe, past the kitchen where a stranger was shouting about craft beer to anyone who would listen. I catalogued faces I would never have to learn the names of. I counted exits. I thought about how long I had to stay before it would be rude to leave.

I told myself I was only there as proof that I could still be invited to things. That showing up was enough, that I didn’t have to let anyone too close, that I could slip out quietly after one drink and no one would notice. Underneath that, quieter, was another rule I never say out loud: if I don’t stay long, no one has time to decide I am not worth keeping. I have always been good at building these little rules for myself, ways to be present without really being there.

Of course, someone noticed.

It started with a laugh that didn’t grate on me. That’s how I remember it. I was standing in the doorway between the living room and the kitchen, cup of something flat and sour in my hand, when I heard it from the balcony: a low, surprised sound, like someone had actually been caught off guard by joy. It cut through the music and the overlapping conversations, and my head turned before I could stop it.

You were out there, leaning against the railing, your shoulders hunched against the cold seeping in through the open door. There were two or three other people around you, their faces already a blur in my memory, but I remember your profile clearly: the way you tilted your head as you listened, the way your mouth folded around the laugh and then tried to hide it, as if happiness was a secret you weren’t supposed to keep.

I told myself I was only looking because the balcony was another exit. Because from there I could see the street, judge how far it was to the pavement if I decided to climb down instead of pushing back through the crowd to the front door. I told myself I had no interest in you at all.

Then you glanced inside, just for a second, and your eyes caught on me like they had been looking for something to land on.

It is embarrassing how quickly I looked away. I stared down into my drink as if the bubbles could give me instructions. Count to five, I thought. If you are still looking at me when I look up, then you are looking at me. This is how I have always negotiated with the world: with little tests no one knows they’re taking.

I looked up at five and you were still turned toward the room. Not staring, not the hungry, assessing look I’m used to, just... anchored. Your conversation had gone on without you. Someone beside you was still talking with the easy, slurred confidence of the drunk, but your attention had stepped away and was standing there with me in the doorway.

You lifted your cup slightly, a small, uncertain salute. I should have pretended not to see it. That is the moment, if we are being honest, where the story could have ended before it began. I could have turned, melted into the crowd, left you on the balcony with your polite, unfinished gesture.

Instead, I raised my own cup back at you.

The path between the doorway and the balcony was only a few meters long, but it felt like crossing a decade. I threaded through people without touching them, ghosting between elbows and shoulders, careful not to brush anyone long enough for them to think I wanted to talk. My heart was too loud in my ears, which annoyed me; it had no right to react like this to a stranger’s glance.

The cold hit me as soon as I stepped outside. It was a small balcony, the kind that barely fits four people and a dying plant. Someone’s cigarette smoke curled up past my face. The city sprawled below us, lights smeared by the condensation on the glass, distant sirens already part of the night’s rhythm.

You greeted me like we were resuming something, not starting from nothing. I answered with something neutral and forgettable; the words themselves never mattered. What mattered was the way you looked at me while we traded them, as if every exchange were a door I could walk through instead of a weapon you were waiting to use.

You did the usual small-talk checklist—where I worked, what I did, how I knew the host—but you actually listened instead of waiting for your turn. When I tossed out one of my usual sharp little jokes, more blade than wit, you didn’t flinch or overcompensate. You only tilted your head, hearing the bruise under the joke, and I resented you for seeing it even as part of me leaned toward that attention.

I gave you a cleaned-up story about a past relationship: the version where I was just difficult, not cruel. You couldn’t know the extent of what I left out—the nights I won’t admit to, the words I flung first so nothing worse could hit me—but your eyes tracked the places my voice hardened, the gaps where the narrative skipped. You didn’t press. You didn’t reach for me in pity. You held my gaze and left the choice of how much to reveal in my hands.

It felt dangerous. Not because of you, but because of what happens to me when I start to hope. When someone looks at me like that, some part of me wants to ruin it before it can ruin me. It has always felt safer to be the one doing the damage than the one standing still while it happens.

So, out of habit, I tried.

I turned the questions sharper, fishing for the places you might be soft: whether you lived alone, whether you had ever betrayed anyone, what the worst thing was you had done and never confessed. I made my tone light, like it was a game.

You didn’t laugh it off or fling the questions back at me. You went quiet instead, watching the tail-lights smear along the wet road below, and when you finally spoke, it was to offer a small, plain story about a moment when you had been careless with someone’s trust and had carried it ever since. Not a performance of guilt. Not a plea for absolution. Just one ordinary failure you refused to forget.

I felt the old, reflexive urge to pick at it—to demand more, to find the hairline cracks—but even in the half-light I could see you had already done that work on yourself. Instead of prying further, I found myself turning your story over in my mind, surprised by how much it mattered that you weren’t trying to impress me with how bad you’d been, or how good you were now. You lived with what you’d done. You didn’t parade it.

Part of me wanted to mock the quiet seriousness of that, to write you off as someone trying too hard to be better. Another part, the one that knew my own worst moments too well, recognized the shape of someone who had decided to hold all their pieces instead of pretending they had never broken them.

You looked at me then in a way that made it clear you were wondering the same thing about me. The answer between us was tentative and conditional: we would see; it depended how long I stayed.

It was such a simple condition, but it landed low in my chest. I am used to people assuming I won’t stay. I cultivate that assumption; it keeps me safe. You held the possibility of my staying like an invitation instead of a warning.

Inside, the song shifted to something slower. The cold out on the balcony suddenly felt sharper, the air between us thinner. I became acutely aware of how little space there was to move without brushing your arm.

You suggested going back in, warmth over cold. My first instinct was to refuse; no is the language my body learned first. But my fingers were going numb around the cup, and I knew if I stayed much longer I would start shaking—from the weather or from something else. I agreed instead. You stepped aside to let me pass, as if I were leading.

Heat and noise crashed back over us as we crossed the threshold. The living room had rearranged itself while we were outside; new faces in the corners, new bodies on the couch. The colored lights blurred everyone into the same anonymous figure.

You offered movement instead of spectacle. No demand that I dance, just a suggestion that we walk. Your hand extended, palm up, not reaching, only offering. I stared at it longer than was socially acceptable, remembering all the hands I had taken before only to twist them later, testing how much pressure it took to make someone let go.

This time I was the one who moved first. I slid my fingers into yours. Your hand was warm, the skin a little rough, the grip neither possessive nor tentative. You simply curled your fingers around mine as if this had always been the obvious next step.

We didn’t dance. We threaded the room the way you’d suggested, walking the perimeter while the party churned in the center. You guided us past the coffee table cluttered with bottles, past the television flickering silently in the corner, past the doorway where the couple from earlier had already been replaced by another. Every few steps someone bumped my shoulder or brushed my hip; each time your hand tightened briefly, steadying without pinning, then loosened again.

It was such a small thing, but my body treated it like evidence: for this thin slice of time, someone cared if I stayed upright.

At some point I felt your breath near my ear as you leaned close enough to make a wry observation about my successfully crossing a room full of strangers. In my head I shot back that, for all you knew, this could be a regression from my usual baseline. You seemed willing to accept that risk. None of it would read as remarkable on a transcript. Inside my chest, it reordered whole categories of what I thought was possible.

We ended up back near the kitchen as if we had completed a slow, pointless orbit. Someone thrust a bowl of chips between us; you used it as a prop to offer a mock peace treaty. I refused, and you let the moment turn into something quieter, asking—not with those exact words, but with a weight I felt in my sternum—what I actually wanted.

The safe answer would have been small: another drink, a cigarette, a lift home. Instead, before I could stop myself, I admitted, in that raw, internal way, that what I wanted was to leave without breaking anything.

You fell into that thoughtful silence that was already becoming familiar and, in your next careful questions and looks, probed whether that was what I usually did—break things. I answered with the same brutal shorthand as always: people, mostly. Including me.

You didn’t flinch or joke it away. You accepted it the way someone might accept a job title, and then offered a different possibility: that tonight I could try something else. Try not assuming I already knew how the night ended. Try letting it surprise me.

Surprise usually means danger to me. In my experience, it's just disappointments with better packaging. But with your eyes on mine and the music thudding at a safer distance, the idea felt—for once—less like a threat and more like an open door. I could feel something inside me lean toward it before the rest of me could drag it back.

Behind you, the television on the counter shifted from a music channel to news footage. Someone must have brushed the remote. For a heartbeat the room filled with a different kind of light—colder, too bright. A presenter’s serious face, a scrolling line of text I didn’t bother to read. The sound was off, so their mouth just opened and closed silently, urgent and useless.

You followed my glance toward the screen and checked on me without needing words, a question in your face about whether I was alright. I treated the images as a joke in my head—just the world ending in mute pantomime, something the remote would fix in a second—because that was easier than letting fear in. Your mouth pulled into a small, strained smile, but your attention stayed on the footage longer than mine, fixed on the ambulance lights strobing at the bottom of the frame and the yellow-jacketed figures moving around something the camera refused to show clearly. Then someone in the kitchen laughed too loudly about something else, the host grabbed the remote, and the room obediently returned to a sunset beach and choreographed happiness. Everyone cheered as if the interruption had just been a badly timed advertisement.


At some point we ended up squeezed together in a narrow stretch of hallway where someone had abandoned a pile of shoes and jackets. A girl I vaguely recognized tried to pull me into a group photo; you stepped between us, not possessive, just offering yourself as a shield. I muttered a familiar insult about my face into your shoulder, half expecting you to confirm it or contradict it too loudly. Instead you dismissed the whole idea with an easy, quiet certainty that landed in my chest like a stone in water. Not a performance, not a compliment designed to win anything—just a refusal to let me reduce myself like that out loud.

You smelled like whatever soap you’d used that morning and the cheap beer from the balcony, and underneath that, something like metal and rain. It’s funny, the things you remember later. I had trained myself not to notice the details that make people real; it only makes it harder when they leave. But with you my mind kept collecting them despite itself, as if some part of me had already decided you were the exception to every rule I’d written about not getting attached.

After the photo crisis had been averted, I wondered how long I would stay. Was there some invisible curfew I hadn’t admitted to? I thought about the stages of my plan: leave after one drink, then after the balcony, then after we walked. But as I looked at you, I drew a line inside my own thoughts. I decided I would stay until you went. It felt like the kind of promise people only make when they are slightly drunk on attention and the possibility of being seen.

I thought about how fragile that promise was, how easily it could be broken. But I also thought about how it felt to have someone to stay for, someone who might notice if I left. It was a small, tentative feeling, but it was there.

Somewhere beyond the thin walls, a siren rose and fell, then rose again in a way that made a couple of people glance toward the window. There was a beat where the song in the living room and the sound outside almost lined up, a strange harmony, and then the siren cut off abruptly. Someone made a joke about the city never sleeping. Someone else muttered something about an accident on the ring road. The conversation slid past me without sticking.

I was tired of shouting, tired of the music telling my heart how fast to beat. I wanted a quieter place, a place where I could think. You seemed to sense that, nodding toward the end of the hallway, where a door stood half-open onto a small side room. The lights were off, but the spill from the corridor outlined a bed and a cluttered desk. It was a private space, a space that wasn’t meant for guests.

I should have said no. A quiet room with a stranger is exactly the kind of situation I try to avoid. But I was tired, and I was curious. So I followed you toward the open door, already rehearsing the excuse we would both use if anyone asked what we’d been looking for.

We stepped into the side room and pulled the door almost closed behind us, leaving a thin wedge of light from the hallway. The music dropped to a muffled thud. For the first time that night, I could hear my own breathing clearly.

The silence was a relief. I felt like I could finally think, finally process everything that had happened. I looked around the room, taking in the cluttered desk and the bed. It was a messy space, but it felt real.

I thought about what you had said earlier, about how exit strategies are stories. I thought about how my life had been a series of exits, a series of escapes. But in that moment, I felt like I was standing still. I felt like I was finally facing something, finally facing someone.

In my head I tried out the word safe and found it catching in my throat. I wasn’t sure yet whether it belonged to you, or to this room, or to me. 

You watched me for a moment in that quiet, patient way of yours, checking whether I was actually alright or just performing it. I realized I’d gone still, staring at nothing in particular, thinking about how much of life was happening in other rooms while we all pretended this one was the whole world. For once, the pretending didn’t feel like a lie. It felt like a choice—one we were both willing to make for a little longer.

It had been a long time since anyone had said that to me and meant it—that I was allowed to want something that wasn’t an apology or an escape. The wanting scared me. But sitting there in that half-lit room, with your hands loose on your knees and your eyes not trying to pin me down, a part of me that I thought I’d buried years ago lifted its head.

I sat down beside you.

We didn’t touch at first. There was a careful, deliberate space between us, wide enough that I could have left at any second without the choreography becoming awkward. I stared at the floorboards, at the scuff marks where chairs had scraped back and forth over the years, at a lone glittery sticker ground into the wood near your shoe.

You broke the silence first, wanting to know if this version of me—this stripped-down, unperformed one—was how I usually was with strangers. It wasn’t. With most people I scattered pieces of myself in jokes and half-truths, never enough in one place for anyone to see the shape. Tonight I’d let more of it surface than I meant to, and you sat there treating it like something you were willing to hold instead of something you needed to dodge.

In my own head I tried the question back on you: how often were you this patient with disasters? Because that’s what I knew myself to be—a slow-moving catastrophe that usually scared people off long before they had time to map the damage. 

You didn’t seem inclined to flee. If anything, you leaned a fraction closer, not in, just toward, as if to say you weren’t waiting for the explosion.

You had your own history with wreckage; I could hear it between the things you chose to say and the things you didn’t. You knew what people looked like when they were about to blow something up just so they didn’t have to wait and see if it survived. By your quiet, steady measure, I didn’t look like that. That should have made me want to prove you wrong, to show you exactly how sharp my edges could be. Instead, it loosened something in my chest. I warned you anyway—at least inside my thoughts—that people like me tend to leave marks. You, in turn, seemed certain that people like you did too. The difference was that yours weren’t as easy to see.

Silence settled between us again, softer this time. From the hallway, a burst of laughter rose and fell, followed by the slam of a door. The music skipped, hiccupped, then continued from the middle of a different song. Somewhere in the plumbing, a pipe clanged like it had been hit too hard.

You turned the attention back on my life without needing a full sentence. A look was enough to ask what I’d thought it was going to be before tonight, before this party, before whatever was starting to press at the edges of the city. Short, I admitted to myself. Noisy. Messy. Mostly other people’s problem. Not this. Not sitting in a dark room with someone who didn’t flinch when I said I broke things.

You kept circling back to that idea—breaking things—as if you were testing the word for weak spots. I called it a talent in my head because self-deprecation still felt safer than gratitude, then, tired of hearing my own rehearsed lines, I nudged the question back toward you. In my imagination you answered with the same careful honesty you’d given me all night: a life made of motion, new jobs and new cities, never staying long enough for anyone to see the pattern. Tonight, though, felt different even to you. For the first time in a long while, staying didn’t seem like the worst thing.

The word _stay_ hung between us, heavier than it should have. My old instincts bristled, ready to bolt, while that newly-awakened part of me leaned toward it like a plant toward light. You didn’t really know me, and some reflexive part of me wanted to insist on that, to push you back to a safer distance. But you seemed to think you knew enough for tonight, that the rest, if we ever got to it, could be figured out tomorrow.

At the time, _if we get a tomorrow_ sounded like the kind of vague, romantic fatalism people toss around at parties when they want to sound deep. I didn’t realize how literal it was about to become.

Your phone buzzed in your pocket. You took it out, glanced at the screen, and your brow furrowed just slightly. Not much—a small tightening around the eyes most people would have missed. I echoed your earlier concern back at you, asking if everything was alright, and got the automatic reassurance in return. The truth was in your hands instead of your voice: a string of messages from someone whose name I didn’t recognize, tumbling in on top of each other.

_Have you seen this?_  
_Turn on the news w sound_  
_Serious this time_  
_They say stay away from the centre_

By the time I looked up from the words, your thumb had already locked the screen. You slid the phone face down on the bed between us like you were putting a lid on something that might otherwise spill out and change the shape of the night.

It did look serious. You tried to treat it like another exaggerated warning, but your eyes weren’t on me anymore. They were on the thin slice of light at the bottom of the door, where shadows moved back and forth as people walked past.

For a moment I considered suggesting we go back out, find the host, ask what was happening. That would have been the sensible thing, the responsible thing. Instead I clung to the fragile promise you’d made earlier about not disappearing without saying goodbye and let that be the anchor that kept us in the room a little longer.

That thought pulled your gaze back to me. The corners of your mouth softened in acknowledgment of the promise you’d made. It was a small thing, but you seemed determined to keep hold of it.

You shifted a little closer then, not enough to touch, just enough that the warmth from your arm reached mine. The space between us narrowed to something I would have to choose to cross.

I could feel another question gathering in you before you shaped it. You had already asked me so much, but this one felt different, heavier. You wanted to know what this could be, if I let myself believe it was anything more than another story I would someday tell about how I broke something. What I would want it to be if I trusted it.

The question landed in the part of me that had lifted its head. I almost pushed it away with a joke. Instead, for once, I let the answer form in my own mind without dressing it up. 

I wanted quiet. Not boredom, not emptiness—just a life where I wasn’t always braced for impact. Not always waiting for the door to slam, or the shouting to start, or the silence to arrive and last for days. 

I wanted the possibility that if I said the wrong thing, it wouldn’t all explode.

You seemed to understand. In my memory, you nodded slowly, filing that away as carefully as I had filed away the feel of your hand. You carried your own dislike of explosions, your own longing for something steadier, and for a moment it felt like we were looking at the same imagined future from opposite sides of the same room. 

I thought about how wrong this party was for both of us, all noise and spectacle and brittle laughter, and the shared, crooked smile that passed between us said you were thinking something similar.

Out in the hallway, something knocked over with a crash that made us both jump. There was a shout, then a peel of hysterical laughter, the kind that doesn’t quite sound like joy. The music cut out abruptly. In the brief, raw silence that followed, we heard it clearly: sirens, more than one now, wailing somewhere too close to be easily dismissed.

The wedge of light under the door flickered as someone ran past. A sharp, too-high voice leaked through the wall, words tripping over themselves about the news and what they were saying, before the rest was swallowed by the slam of another door and the sudden, jagged thump of the stereo coming back on at a lower volume.

I glanced at you. You were already looking at me.

In your face was the quiet suggestion that maybe we should find out what everyone else was suddenly so afraid of. I wanted to say no. I wanted to stay in that small, borrowed quiet with you, to keep pretending the rest of the world was just background noise. But the look in your eyes told me we had already stepped over some invisible line without noticing.

I agreed, with one condition I didn’t quite dare voice: that you wouldn’t use the chaos outside this room as an excuse to slip away. In my head I held onto the fragile promise you’d made about not disappearing without saying goodbye and let that be the anchor that got me moving.

We stood up together.

When I opened the door, the hallway felt smaller than it had a few minutes before. The air was thicker, like the party had been left to simmer while we were gone. People moved faster now, their conversations pitched a little higher. The music from the living room thumped at a cautious, half-hearted volume, as if the stereo itself was waiting to see what would happen next.

We stepped back into the main room and were immediately brushed by someone rushing past with their phone held in front of their face, narrating breathlessly to no one in particular about how whatever was happening was everywhere now, in more than one city.

From the couch came the familiar counterpoint of disbelief, someone insisting it was all exaggeration, that they always blew these things out of proportion. Another voice cut through, thinner and rawer, talking about a sister at a hospital they suddenly weren’t allowed to leave.

The crowd had shifted toward the television. The beach video was gone; this time the news was on with the sound turned up. The presenter’s voice strained for calm over footage of a street I thought I recognized, though it could have been any street in any city: flashing lights, barricades, figures in masks moving between hunched shapes on the ground.

_Unidentified infection._  
_Rapid onset aggression._  
_Isolate and avoid contact._

The words crawled along the bottom of the screen while the presenter talked about emergency measures, about staying indoors, about not panicking. On the grainy footage behind them, someone lurched toward the camera and was pushed back by three people at once. The shot cut away before we saw what happened next.

In my head I tried to make a joke about how reassuring it all was, because my mouth doesn’t know how to be quiet when it’s scared. The humour fell flat even inside my own skull.

You stood close enough that I could feel your shoulder near mine, but not quite touching. Your eyes stayed on the screen, clinging to the idea that whoever was in charge would handle it, the way people always say they will. Somewhere nearby, someone scoffed at that faith and started listing all the times they hadn’t.

A chorus of overlapping opinions rose around us—about governments and cover-ups and the inevitability of disaster. It all blurred into noise. What I remember clearly is the way you finally turned your head then, looking at me instead of the television.

In that look was another question: did I want to leave? Every alarm in me went off at once. Leaving is my default, my safety valve. But the thought of stepping out into whatever waited beyond the building, of letting go of this brief, strange orbit we’d built, made my skin go cold.

I pictured the two of us alone in a city I suddenly didn’t recognize, compared it to the uneasy safety of this crowded, overheated room. 

I tried, and failed, to turn that calculus into a joke about there being more targets here than out there. The fear underneath it was harder to dress up.

You almost smiled at the attempt. Almost. Your answer, unspoken but clear, was that we didn’t have to decide yet. We could wait, for one more moment, to see what they said next.

As if on cue, the footage cut to a live press conference. A tired-looking official stood at a podium, flanked by others in dark suits. They said words like _containment_ and _clusters_ and _symptoms_, but half the people in the room were already talking over them, comparing what we were hearing to what they were seeing in their feeds.

My own phone buzzed in my pocket. I didn’t take it out. Whoever it was, whatever they wanted to tell me, could wait. For once, I didn’t want to be the first one to run.

Someone near the window sucked in a sharp breath. “Look,” they said. “Down there.”

We turned with the rest of them. From the sixth floor, the street below looked like a miniature version of the news footage: flashing blue lights, the stutter of hazard blinkers, a knot of people gathered around something I couldn’t quite see. One of them broke away, stumbling into the road, arms windmilling like a puppet whose strings had been cut.

“Drunk,” someone said dismissively.

“They don’t move like that,” another voice said. “Something’s wrong with their leg.”

The stumbling figure collided with a parked car and bounced off without putting their hands out to catch themselves. They hit the ground hard, then pushed back to their feet in a way that made the hair on my arms stand up. Not like someone finding their balance. Like something remembering how joints worked.

The room pulled back from the glass all at once, a collective flinch. Somebody started to laugh, a high, brittle sound. It died quickly.

You went quiet in a way that admitted, without saying it aloud, that this might actually be something. The host clapped their hands too loudly, calling for calm, talking about locked doors and waiting it out, trying to stitch the room back together with the promise of another round of drinks. Half the room lifted their cups by reflex. The other half reached for their phones.

You leaned closer, your shoulder finally brushing mine. I could feel, as clearly as if you had spoken it into my ear, the thought you carried: if this went bad, you wanted me near you.

In my head I made a brittle joke about you planning to throw yourself between me and whatever was coming, and you answered—with a look, with a shift of your shoulder—that if things went bad you at least wanted us to be running in the same direction. It shouldn’t have made me feel safer. You were just a person at a party with a phone full of unanswered messages and no more information than anyone else. But the idea of having even one constant point in a room that had started to tilt made my grip on my cup steady a little.

We stood there like that, side by side, while the night outside our window shifted from normal to not, pixel by pixel. Later, I would wonder if there had been a single moment we could point to as the last instant _before_—the last second when leaving would have meant something different. In that room, though, with your shoulder warm against mine and the sirens rising and falling like a new kind of weather, all I could think was that for the first time in a very long time, I was not planning my exit alone.

The moment passed when the front door crashed open so hard it rattled the frames on the wall.

Everyone’s head snapped toward the hallway. For a beat, the music kept playing, absurdly jaunty under the sharp sound of someone stumbling inside and slamming the door behind them.

Someone near the door started babbling in a high, ragged stream about locks and stairs and something coming up toward us. The host pushed through the crowd with their hands up, trying to restore an order that was already gone.

The newcomer—a man I dimly recognized from earlier in the evening, the one who had been shouting about craft beer in the kitchen—shoved past them, shoulders scraping the wall as he careened into the living room. His face was grey under the sweaty shine, eyes blown wide. One sleeve of his shirt was torn to the elbow. Fragments of his words broke over us: not just on TV, outside, here, the air itself hurting him to pull in.

Someone grabbed his arm to steady him. That was when I saw it.

Not a cut. Not a bruise. A row of perfect, rounded marks sunk into the soft flesh of his forearm, deep enough that I could see where the teeth had met. The skin around them was already darkening, an ugly, spreading color, like rot starting under the surface of fruit.

The host followed my gaze and demanded to know what had happened to him. The answer—something about a dog, tossed out too quickly—skittered across the room, snatched up and filed away by whoever needed it to be ordinary.

It was not fine. No dog I’d ever seen bit like that. The pattern was too clean, too human.

No one else seemed to see it the way I did. They saw only sweat and panic and shaking hands. They heard the word _dog_ and filed it under _unfortunate_, not _dangerous_. The room surged toward him and away from him at the same time, people crowding in with questions while others edged back toward the walls.

You felt me tense beside you and followed the line of my stare. My mouth had gone dry around the words I managed to force out: that it was his arm, that they should look at his arm. You narrowed your eyes, trying to catch a glimpse through the shifting bodies, and for a moment the crowd parted just enough for you to see the marks. The way your jaw tightened told me you understood. Whatever had done that wasn’t an animal we knew how to name.

As if hearing the shift in the room, or maybe just feeling all the eyes on him, he yanked his arm back and dragged the torn sleeve down, trying to cover the damage. He insisted—too loudly, too often—that it was fine, that staying inside was safest, that something terrible had been in the lobby, banging on the glass.

A heavy thud from somewhere below us cut through his words, followed by sharper impacts, like fists—or something harder—hammering metal. The heating pipes shuddered. The music died again, this time for good. Around us, voices frayed at the edges: some whispering that we should go, others parroting the advice from the news about staying put, others still scoffing that they’d said it was handled. Your hand brushed mine, a small, grounding contact, and even without you repeating it out loud I heard the thought as clearly as if you had: stay near me.

Another crash from the stairwell. This one made a picture fall off the wall and shatter on the floor. A few people screamed, the sound thin and useless.

Someone killed the lights.

For a second, no one breathed. The only sound was the hiss of the radiators and the muffled wail of sirens outside. Then the room erupted.

People shouted for their friends, for their phones, for the host. Someone turned their flashlight on and waved it around, slicing the darkness into brief, disorienting snapshots: a pale face here, a raised arm there, the glint of a bottle too close to someone’s head. The host tried to project calm into the chaos, shouting something about fuses and accidents, but their reassurances were cut off by a scream that tore down the hallway—raw and animal, nothing like the brittle party shrieks from earlier.

Some part of you wanted me to stay where it was safe. Some part of me refused. In the end, neither of us let go; you were already moving toward the sound, and I felt my body pulled along in your wake.

The narrow corridor was chaos. In the stuttering beam of someone’s phone, I saw bodies trying to push in both directions at once—toward the front door, away from the stairwell. The bitten man was slumped against the wall near the entrance, one hand clamped over his arm, teeth bared in a grimace that didn’t look entirely like pain.

He was rasping warnings at anyone who tried to get past him, insisting there was something in the building, on the stairs, too close. His voice broke, dissolved into a wet cough that painted the wall beside him a darker shade of the same nightmare color blooming under his sleeve.

The person nearest him recoiled, slipping on… something. My brain refused to name it. They went down hard, dragging another with them. The hallway became a tangle of limbs and shouted apologies.

You leaned close enough that your words brushed my ear, urging us backward, angling for the fire escape in the kitchen instead of the front door. Some part of me wanted to argue, to ask what if that was worse, but my feet were already obeying, moving us sideways instead of straight ahead.

Behind us, closer to the door, there was another sound—like meat hitting tile, followed by a gurgling choke. The bitten man’s voice rose one more time, then stopped so abruptly it felt as if someone had hit mute on him alone.

You didn’t look back. I did.

In the jittering light, I saw his hand slide down the wall, leaving a dark smear, and then his head turn in a way that made my stomach flip. Too fast. Too sharp. His eyes, when they caught the thin beam, were wrong. Not blind, not vacant—too intent. Fixed on the nearest moving shape with a focus that had nothing to do with recognition.

The flashlight dropped, clattering to the floor and spinning, throwing wild shadows as whoever held it stumbled away.

Every line of your body said it was time to go.

We pushed back into the main room. Someone had opened the windows to the balcony, trying to get air or escape or both. Cold wind knifed through the heat of too many bodies. Outside, the street was a mess of lights and motion we couldn’t parse from this height.

You steered us toward the kitchen, mind fixed on the plan you’d already chosen. People grabbed at us as we passed—hands on my arm, on your shoulders, all asking the same questions: what was going on, whether it was real, what we had seen. I shook them off without answering. There were no good words for what I had seen.

We reached the kitchen just as someone yanked the fire-escape door open. A blast of stairwell air hit us—metallic, cold, laced with a smell I couldn’t place yet, something sour and sharp threaded through with the iron tang of blood.

The host tried to impose order on the kitchen, calling for people to use the fire escape one at a time, but panic doesn’t queue. Bodies surged toward the narrow exit, jamming themselves into the doorway. Someone fell forward and was stepped on, a brief, awful sound swallowed under a tide of legs.

You weighed the bottleneck in front of us against the hallway behind and reached the conclusion faster than I could voice it: if we joined that crush we’d be ground down with everyone else. My own thoughts ran alongside yours, wild and useless, asking whether staying here with whatever was in the hall could really be any safer.

As if summoned by my words, a figure lurched into the kitchen doorway from the corridor. For a heartbeat I thought it was the bitten man again, but this body moved differently—too loosely, as if the joints had been replaced with hinges not made for a human frame. Their clothes were wrong for the party, too: no glitter, no denim, just a dark jacket smeared with something thick.

The person at the back of the crowd turned, saw the newcomer in the doorway, and let out a shriek that rippled forward, multiplying down the line of bodies. The figure’s head snapped toward the noise. Their eyes caught mine for a fraction of a second. There was nothing in them I knew how to talk to. Somewhere in the crush, someone hurled a bottle that shattered against the doorframe, glass skittering under our feet.

The crowd shoved harder toward the fire escape, turning the doorway into a grinder. You pulled me in the opposite direction, toward the counter, away from both exits.

You dropped to your knees in one smooth motion, dragging me down with you, aiming us for the dark wedge between the lower cabinets and the table leg. We squeezed ourselves into the gap, the press of other people’s calves all around us.

From the floor, the world became pieces: shoes skidding, glass falling, liquid—drinks, I told myself, only drinks—spilling and seeping toward the grout. Above, I heard a heavy body slam into something, heard the sick, cracking sound of impact followed by a chorus of panicked cries.

Someone fell on top of the table, sending crumbs and empty cups raining down. A different weight thudded against the cabinets inches from my head, hard enough to make the wood bow in for a second before springing back.

Something—a hand, a foot, I couldn’t tell—hit me across the side of the face. Pain flared along my jaw. I tasted metal. You were a harsh whisper beside me, all urgency and pressure, your fingers finding mine in the dark and squeezing so hard it almost hurt, anchoring me to the floor.

Then, in the confusion, someone’s leg crashed into my shoulder, forcing me sideways out from under the small shelter we’d claimed. I slid across the sticky tiles, hands scrabbling for purchase, and slammed into something hard and unseen.

For a moment all I registered was warmth and weight and the smell of something wet and wrong. Then a sharp edge—glass, metal, I couldn’t tell—caught my forearm.

The pain came before the understanding: a sudden, slicing heat, like my skin had simply opened of its own accord. I heard myself scream, high and shocked, the sound ripped out of me before I could catch it.

Hands grabbed at me, pulling me up and away from whatever I’d hit. I caught a flash of a face smeared and slick, a mouth working too hard around nothing, eyes rolled white, but by then everything had blurred into shapes and noise.

You were there a heartbeat later, your hands on my shoulders, trying to steady more than just my body. Blood was already running hot down my wrist, thick between my fingers as I clutched at the wound. The edges burned, a deep, electric sting that made my vision blur. You saw it and something desperate flashed across your face—a calculation about what to do with this new damage. Every line of you said the same thing: I was hurt and you needed to get me out. In my own head, stubborn and distant, another thought surfaced: everyone needed to get out, not just me. My voice, when it came, sounded far away to my own ears, as if it belonged to someone standing in another room.

Someone shoved into you from behind, driving us apart by a step. Another body slammed between us—a stranger’s back, a stranger’s fear. You reached past them for me, fingers brushing my wrist in a silent plea that I stay with you, and in my own mind I answered with all the intention I had left that I was trying.

The crowd surged again, this time toward the interior hallway, away from the fire escape where someone had started shouting about people on the stairs. I was caught in the pull, dragged sideways. Your hand slipped from mine.

I glimpsed you over a sea of shoulders—your mouth forming my name I never gave you, just the shape of me, your arm outstretched—as someone grabbed at you from the other side, begging you not to leave them.

Then the current took me.

---

By the time the city stopped shaking, it was hard to remember how many nights had passed.

The streets emptied first. Not all at once, not like in the films. People just stopped using certain routes, certain corners, certain stairwells. Whole blocks went quiet, their windows dark, their doors nailed shut or hanging open. The wind learned new paths through the broken glass.

What was left fell into two kinds of movement.

There was _us_, and there was _them_. Both words felt flimsy, but they were what we had.

From a distance we looked the same: silhouettes slipping between buildings, shapes hunched around fires made from broken furniture, figures darting from doorway to doorway when something shifted in the dark. Up close, the differences were in what we moved toward and what we pulled away from.

They moved together, most of the time. In knots and clusters, close enough to touch, like people afraid of losing each other in a crowd that wasn’t there anymore. They stayed near the places that still had light of some kind, even if it was only a single flickering bulb over a doorway.

We moved around those pools of light, keeping to the edges. We learned the quiet routes, the hollow places, the paths where footsteps didn’t echo as much. If there were groups of us, we did not walk shoulder to shoulder. Old habits die hard.

For a long time, my group was small enough to count on one hand.

We hid where the others didn’t bother looking: under collapsed staircases, inside gutted buses, in the hollow bellies of shops whose fronts had been burned out. We took turns staying awake. We shared what we found. We learned each other’s breathing patterns in the dark.

They drove us out of places without ever quite saying that’s what they were doing. Maybe in their stories we were the hunters. Maybe they sat around their fires and talked about the things that moved too quietly, that didn’t answer when called, that didn’t breathe the way they remembered.

It would be easy to say they were monsters. It felt that way, when we had to abandon a hoard of blankets because they were sweeping through floor by floor, when one of ours failed to come back from a scouting run and we found only marks on the walls where something hard had struck too many times.

But we saw things in ourselves that didn’t fit cleanly into the word _victim_ either. The way some of us moved faster now, or farther, or didn’t seem to tire the way we used to. The way our bodies learned new rules without asking our permission.

For a while, it seemed like we would simply thin out and vanish. Each week there were fewer of us waking up to the grey light. Each week we had to search farther for familiar faces.

Then, somehow, there were more.

They came to us out of the ruins in ones and twos, like seeds blown off course. People with the same watchful stillness in their eyes, the same wrongness in the way they held themselves that made the others flinch. Some staggered in alone. Some arrived being half-dragged by someone who refused to leave them behind.

We made space. We always made space. It’s strangely easy, once you’ve lost enough, to decide that everyone who finds you gets a corner by the fire.

In the quiet stretches between alarms, we tried to understand _why_ they pushed us out of every space we tried to claim.

We watched them from the edges of whatever light they still trusted. The way they clustered in entrances, how their heads all turned at once when something moved. The way their mouths shaped sounds we could no longer quite parse, as if an invisible pane of glass sat between us and turned their voices into muffled echoes.

We told ourselves it was habit, or instinct, or some old reflex that told them anything different had to be driven away before it got too close.

So we tried to show them we weren’t only what they told each other we were.

Sometimes that meant stepping out of a doorway with nothing in our hands. Sometimes it meant standing still when every part of us wanted to run, just to prove we could choose not to move toward them.

The sounds that came back were always wrong somehow—too loud, too sharp, too fast. We couldn’t tell if they were warning us off or calling for help. Either way, the result was the same: we ended up back in the shadows, hearts pounding, their outlines burned into our vision.

We tried other kinds of signals.

We left food where we knew _they_ would pass. Not as a bargain, just as proof that we could give without taking. We returned things we’d picked up in the scramble to get away: a backpack, a photograph, a scarf that smelled like someone else’s perfume.

Sometimes those offerings vanished between one watch and the next. Sometimes we found them trampled, or kicked into the gutter, or marked over with broad, angry strokes of paint or ash.

Once, someone in our group swore they saw one of _them_ pause, pick up a shard of mirrored glass we had propped against a wall, and turn it toward the street like they were trying to catch our reflection.

“Maybe they’re trying too,” someone said by the fire that night. “Maybe it sounds just as wrong from their side.”

Through all of it, I was looking for you.

Every time we crossed a plaza or cut through a half-collapsed mall, I scanned the faces that turned toward us with whatever passed for recognition on their side. Every time we watched _them_ from behind broken glass, I traced their outlines against the light, asking myself if any of them carried themselves the way you had at that party—like someone who wanted to stay, for once, instead of already half-turned toward the door.

Others in my group searched too, though not for you. They pointed out shapes that matched old memories: a certain tilt of the head, a way of standing with one foot turned out. Once, one of us stepped too far into the open because they were sure they had seen their brother at the end of the street.

They called his name—the old one, from before. The figure turned. For a moment they stared at each other across the distance, two points on opposite sides of a line neither of them had drawn.

Whatever lived behind his eyes now did not seem to know who was calling.

He turned away. The ones with him moved on. We had to drag our own back into hiding.

In the stories we told ourselves by the fire, there were always two possible endings for you.

In one, you were with them, in whatever passed for safety now. Your hands steady, your eyes hardening each time someone like me stepped into your line of sight. In that ending, finding you would mean watching you lift whatever passed for a weapon and aim it at my chest.

In the other, you were with us, somewhere we hadn’t reached yet. Moving through the city with the same wrongness in your step and the same stubbornness in your gaze. In that ending, if I found you, we could stand on the same side of whatever line the world had drawn and not be a danger to one another.

I told myself I hoped for the second version. That I wanted you to be like me now, whatever that meant, so I could keep the memory of your eyes soft and your hand warm without having to imagine you flinching away.

Most nights, if I’m honest, I settled for hoping you were still moving somewhere under this broken sky at all.

---

The night I finally saw you again was almost an accident.

We were moving along the edge of a wide street, keeping to the broken shade of awnings and balconies. The sky had the flat, bruised color it gets just before full dark, when the city seems to hold its breath and decide what kind of night it’s going to be.

There were more of us now. Enough that our footsteps made a low, steady sound, like distant water. We had learned how to keep close without crowding, how to move as a group without jostling each other into the open.

At the far end of the street, shapes crossed our path.

They always moved differently, the ones we called _them_. A little tighter, a little more upright, as if some part of them still believed there was an audience watching from the windows. There were maybe six or seven, strung out along the road like beads on a line. They were carrying… things. Bundles. Bags. One of them kept gesturing up toward the rooftops, checking angles, tracing routes we could not quite see from where we were.

And then there was you.

I didn’t recognize your face at first. Time and hunger and whatever this new life was had sharpened everyone into a different version of themselves. But there was something in the way you turned when the one beside you touched your arm. The small, automatic pause you took before answering. The way you scanned the street not just for danger, but for exits.

My body knew you before my thoughts caught up.

I slowed. Those nearest me slowed too, our pace shifting without a word. We bled back into the deeper shadows, letting the distance between us and them stretch just enough that we could follow without being seen.

You did not look our way. Your attention stayed on the corners, on the doorways, on the mouths of side streets where anything might suddenly appear. If there was an old thread between us still, it stayed coiled and quiet.

You and the ones with you turned off the main road and headed toward a narrower side street. We followed along the outer edge, keeping buildings between us where we could. From time to time I lost sight of you behind a jut of masonry or a sagging balcony, and each time a small, stubborn panic flared until your outline slipped back into view.

The street funneled toward a single building.

From this angle, it was just another grey block with boarded windows and a door hanging crooked on its hinges. Nothing special. Nothing remarkable.

Even so, something in me flinched.

The tilt of the doorway. The way the upper floors leaned a fraction over the street. The faint, remembered smell that seemed to rise from the cracked steps even at this distance: old smoke, cheap alcohol, the ghost of perfume over sweat.

I told myself all buildings smelled like that now.

You disappeared inside. One after another, the others slipped through the doorway after you. The street emptied behind you as if you had never been there at all.

We waited, pressed into the shadow of a half-collapsed shopfront, listening.

Muffled sounds filtered out into the street. Footsteps on hollow stairs. A door slamming somewhere higher up. A voice, briefly raised, then swallowed by walls.

We moved.

No one said anything. There was only the soft scuff of our feet and the small adjustments of bodies used to moving together in tight spaces. We crossed the strip of open ground and reached the door you had gone through.

Up close, the building’s familiarity settled over me like a thin layer of dust.

The angle of the stairwell. The cracked tile with a starburst pattern two steps up. The way the light from the street never quite reached the landing.

My hand found the banister. For a moment, my fingers curled around it exactly as they had on a different night, when the biggest choice in front of me had been whether to leave early and go home alone.

I pushed the memory down and started to climb.

By the time we reached the sixth floor, the air tasted like dust and something sharper. Doors slammed somewhere ahead of us. There were noises that might have been shouts or might have been something else entirely, turned to pure alarm by distance and plaster.

The stairwell door at the top had something shoved against it on the other side. We leaned into it until whatever it was scraped and toppled and clattered back down the stairs behind us. For a moment the noise drowned out everything else.

We spilled into the hallway.

It was longer than I remembered and shorter in the same breath. A strip of peeling wallpaper I had once traced with my eyes while pretending to listen to someone at the party was now half-peeled away, exposing raw plaster. The same picture hook, empty now, still jutted from the wall at shoulder height.

The door to the apartment where we had first met was open.

They noticed us the instant we filled the doorway.

Whatever was already happening in the room—an argument, a hurried attempt to block another exit, hands pushing at furniture—broke apart and reformed around us. Heads snapped toward the door. Arms lifted. The motion in the space changed from frantic to feral in the span of a breath.

For a heartbeat, the room was just a room beneath all of that.

The same shape. The same windows, now cracked and webbed with grime. The same patch on the wall where a poster had once hung. The same corner where the makeshift bar had been. All of it stripped down to skeleton: broken furniture, blackened patches on the floor where something had burned too long, glass ground into the boards.

Then the overlay slammed into place.

Movement. Impact. The wet sound of bodies colliding too hard. A flash in the air—metal, maybe, or broken glass catching what little light there was. Something cracked against plaster with a sound like a gunshot, whether or not it was one. Someone went down near the far wall and didn’t get back up fast enough.

When one of them hit the floor close to us, two of mine were already there, too quick, too close. There was the dull thud of blows landing and, under it, other sounds I had learned not to examine too closely: the low, hungry noises people make when they forget they are supposed to be people at all.

Blood slicked the boards, bright where it found a stray shaft of light, dark everywhere else. Feet slipped in it. Hands grabbed at anything solid. Teeth flashed once, twice, in the crush—not metaphorical this time, but real and bared and closing on whatever they could find.

The noise of it—all the shouts and crashes and wordless cries—rose around me in a jagged, choking wave.

For a moment, I was in two nights at once.

The first one had music instead of this raw, arrhythmic roar, but the rhythm underneath was the same: people jostling, glasses breaking, someone screaming somewhere you couldn’t quite see. A body stumbling into me, spilling a drink, laughing too loudly to cover how close they’d come to falling. The dizzy, tilting sense that the room had become too small to hold everything happening inside it.

The second was this one: no music, only the percussion of fists and whatever else people had picked up to swing, the wet skid of feet through something that wasn’t beer, the high thin edge of real fear in voices that had once only known how to shout to be heard over a song.

The rooms slid over each other like two images struggling to line up. 

The same angles. The same scuffed patch of wall near the kitchen door. The same place on the floor where, once, my hand had touched yours for the first time.

Recognition hit me low and hard.

This was where I had met you. This was where the night had broken the first time, even if I hadn’t known yet what kind of breaking it was.

The present rushed back in all at once.

They were there—your side—clustered near the far wall, backs half-turned toward us, as if you couldn’t quite decide whether to face the windows or the door. We were in the doorway and pushing into the space, my group fanning out around me, pulled by the same invisible gravity that had dragged us all up here in the first place.

Your people were too still.

Even in the noise, in the staggering and the slipping and the flailing for balance, there was a held quality to them, a tightness around the shoulders, a shared flinch that moved through the group like a single animal reacting to a pain only it could feel. 

One of them had a strip of cloth tied around their wrist, stained dark in a spreading ring. Another’s eyes were wide and glass-bright, fixed not on us but on some middle distance, as if listening for a sound the rest of us couldn’t hear yet.

For a moment, it was easy—too easy—to believe the stories my side told about yours. That you moved together like that because something ran through you that we didn’t have anymore. That you were the ones who carried it now, whatever it was.

Someone behind me shifted, a soft, warning sound that barely made it past their teeth. On your side, a hand lifted toward you, fingers closing around empty air before falling again. The air between us crackled with the memory of all the times our attempts at understanding had collapsed into flight and pursuit.

I barely saw any of it.

You were in the middle of your group, a little ahead of them, a little behind. Exactly like at the party, never quite at the center of things, always half-positioned to leave.

Our eyes met again.

It was suddenly, stupidly important to know where the exits were.

Old habits flared up, the ones from before any of this, from nights in too-loud rooms where I would stand with my back to the wall and quietly map the doors while pretending to listen. 

I felt myself count without meaning to—the hallway behind me, the window near you, the narrow balcony door I knew, from another night overlaid on this one, could jam if too many people pushed at once.

I had told myself I was past that. That whatever I had become since the party had stripped away those small, anxious rituals. But here, with you, they came back as easily as breathing.

You took a step toward me.

No one told you to. No one stopped you. Your group rippled around the movement, some of them tensing, some of them leaning back, as if my side were the edge of a fire they weren’t sure you should get too close to.

Behind me, a murmur rippled through my own people. I could feel their focus shift, could sense the held-back tide of whatever it was that drove them now. Driven us. No one moved yet. Maybe they were waiting to see what I would do. Maybe they were waiting to see what you would.

We were perhaps ten paces apart now. Close enough that I could see the new lines around your eyes, the way your shoulders carried weight they hadn’t carried before. Close enough that you could see, if you looked, the ways I had changed too.

I wondered what I looked like to you.

Did you see the way my movements had become a fraction too smooth, as if someone had sanded down the stops between them? Did you notice how still I was when I wasn’t forcing myself to move, how my chest rose and fell as if it had to remind itself to keep doing it? Did you see the way the others behind me unconsciously angled toward me, as if I were some kind of anchor in a world that no longer had many?

You glanced around the room then, taking in the scorch marks and the shattered bottles and the place on the floor where we had once stood hand in hand, pretending the night could still end with a train ride home. When your gaze came back to me, something had shifted in it.

Something flickered in your expression. Grief, maybe. Or recognition. Or the realization that whatever stood in front of you now was not exactly the person you had met that night, but carried her inside like a memory in a burned-out room.

Behind you, someone shifted again, impatient or afraid or both. The tension in the air ratcheted tighter. On both sides, bodies leaned forward without quite stepping. It would not take much to tip the room from this thin, strange stillness into tearing chaos.

I thought of leaving. I thought of what would happen if I turned now, if I let the old instinct win and followed it back down the stairs, out into the splintered street, away from the place where everything had started to break.

Instead, I took a step closer.

The strip of floor between us narrowed. Seven paces. Six. I could feel my group tighten behind me, the way a muscle tenses before a blow or a reach. Your people shifted in mirror to them, as if our two halves of the room were connected by some invisible hinge.

You didn’t speak. You didn’t need to. Everything I had ever heard from you was already echoing in my head.

You don’t know what I am now, I thought, and then corrected myself: you don’t know what I’ve admitted to being. You know who I was in one room on one night. You know the version of me that still believed leaving early could save everyone a lot of trouble.

I took another step. The room seemed to narrow around us until there was only the strip of floor between your boots and mine.

Look at me, I thought. Really look.

You did.

For a moment, it felt like standing on that balcony again, the city spread out below us, sirens still just part of the distant wallpaper of the night. The same steady gaze. The same careful listening.

Then I saw the moment when you noticed the differences.

The pallor that was not entirely from lack of sun. The way my hands hung a little too loosely at my sides, like I had to remember to put tension into them. The absence of certain small, automatic movements—blinking, swallowing—that you had never had to think about before you met me like this.

Your shoulders flinched, just once, the way people do when they step too close to a draft they hadn’t expected.

You’re cold, I imagined you saying, and felt the truth of it settle over us both.

It wasn’t an accusation. Not quite. It was a fact, the way the cracked window was a fact, the way the blood on the boards was a fact, the way the night outside went on whether we stood here or not.

It’s quieter, this way, I thought. Less noise. Less panic. I don’t shake anymore when people touch me.

I lifted my hand, very slowly, giving you all the time in the world to step back.

You didn’t.

My fingers brushed the inside of your wrist.

For a second, nothing existed but that point of contact.

Your skin was warm. Not the easy warmth of the party, when you had been just another body in a crowded room, but a fierce, stubborn heat, like something refusing to go out.

I felt it travel up my arm like an electric line, hitting all the places inside me that had gone so still.

Around us, the room did not pause to make space for this. Somewhere to my left, something heavy hit the floor with a wet crack. Someone shouted—a raw, wordless sound—followed by the scrape of bodies struggling for advantage or escape. Feet still skidded in blood. Glass still broke. The violence didn’t thin out; it only flowed around us, adjusting, the way water diverts around a rock.



For the first time in a long time, I felt almost safe there, held in that narrow strip of unnoticed space where no one seemed to see me except you.

We stood there, hand to hand, on the exact patch of floor where we had first met, the past and the present laid over each other so precisely it hurt to look at.

In another story, maybe this is the moment where something miraculous happens. Where my body remembers how to be warm all the way through, or yours learns how to live with the cold. Where the two halves of the city find a way to speak.

This is not that story.

I don’t know if you pull away. I don’t know if they drag you back. I don’t know if the next sound in this room is a cry or a crack or the kind of silence that never ends.

All I know is the feel of your pulse against my fingers, hot and fast, and the way my own heart, somewhere deep in this quiet, stubborn body, reaches for it.

I have never wanted anything as much as I want you to warm what’s left of me, and, in the same breath, I have never wanted anything as much as I want you to go cold like I am.
