# Where the Exits Are

At a crowded party, a woman who always plans her escape routes meets someone who makes her want to stay. For one night, she believes she might finally be seen without being feared.

Then the world ends.

Now, in the ruins of a broken city, she searches for the person who briefly made her feel safe. But the city has changed them both in different ways, and they stand on opposite sides of a divide that may be impossible to cross.

A haunting story of connection and what remains of love when the world ends.
